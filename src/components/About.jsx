          I'm a passionate software engineer with 3 years of experience in full-stack development, Android app development, and software testing. I specialize in building performant, user-friendly web and mobile applications using technologies like JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Java/Kotlin for Android.

I enjoy solving real-world problems with clean, maintainable code and intuitive design. My work spans frontend and backend systems, mobile development, test automation, and cloud-based solutions using platforms like Firebase and AWS. I'm experienced in implementing CI/CD pipelines, writing robust unit/integration tests, and optimizing performance across platforms.

I'm always exploring new technologies, refining my development workflow, and sharing knowledge within the tech community. I'm currently open to exciting roles in frontend, mobile, or cloud-focused developmentâ€”especially those that allow me to grow while contributing to meaningful projects.
